# To-Do

# Derivatives

- How to handle derivatives with types such as subset(variable)
- Is it the best solution to store all different kind of constants in AllVars?
- Need a assignment function for IsVarPointer --> than one can use Vec<double, VarPointer<decltype(av), 0, 0>, VariableTypeTrait> vp1(av) as normal variable

# Types

- does different types of vector work well together
- remove not required traits

# Required code

- update all unary functions
- update all binary functions
- update subsetting
- update interpolation
- update helper
- update printing
